# Video-Player
React can also be used to work with the HTML video element and toggle between different videos.
# How to build it
In our project, we will allow users to toggle through several different videos using a radio input. We will not only see how to work with radio inputs in forms in React, but how to pass props down to our two components, Menu and Video.

In particular, we will learn how to pass down functions to update state in the parent components from the child component. This pattern is called lifting state up and is a very important pattern to know in React.

A fun way to improve this project would be to add a button to extend the functionality of the video player. For example, to add buttons to control whether the video is looped, whether the video autoplays, and more.
